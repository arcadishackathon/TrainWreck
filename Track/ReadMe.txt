Hi! This is the Trainwreck dev team!

We made this tool 25th and 26th of July 2019 during the Autodesk Toronto Hackathon.
The idea is to have a tracker that is able to show the changes between two graphs
The opened graph is referred to as the Current graph
The graph to compare is referred to as the Reference graph

The added and removed nodes comparison toggles work, the rest have yet to be implemented.

Known issues:
1) be sure to set running graphs to automatically before using the tool.
